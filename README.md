# Song Popularity Prediction Project

This project explores the factors influencing song popularity on a music streaming platform. By applying machine learning techniques, we aim to:

* **Identify** the most significant features contributing to song popularity.
* **Develop** predictive models that can accurately estimate a song's popularity based on its audio features and metadata.
* **Gain insights** into the music industry and consumer preferences.

## Dataset Description

**Data Source and Collection:**

* **Origin:** [Specify the source of the dataset, e.g., personal collection, public dataset repository]
* **Collection Method:** [Describe how the data was collected, e.g., web scraping, API calls, user-generated content]

**Data Fields:**

* **Song Title:** The name of the song.
* **Album:** The album the song belongs to.
* **Artist:** The primary artist of the song. (Consider including additional artist information if available)
* **Release Date:** The year the song was released.
* **Genre:** The primary genre of the song. (Consider a multi-genre label system if applicable)
* **Spotify Link:** A link to the song on Spotify.
* **Song Image:** A link to the song's album cover image. (Optional)
* **Spotify URI:** A unique identifier for the song on Spotify. (Optional)
* **Popularity:** The popularity score of the song on a scale of 0-100. (Specify the metric used)
* **Acousticness:** A measure of how acoustic the track is.
* **Danceability:** Describes how suitable a track is for dancing.
* **Energy:** A measure of a track's intensity and activity.
* **Instrumentalness:** Predicts whether a track contains no vocals.
* **Liveness:** Detects the presence of an audience in the recording.
* **Loudness:** The overall loudness of a track in decibels.
* **Speechiness:** Detects the presence of spoken words in a track.
* **Tempo:** The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM).
* **Valence:** A measure of musical positiveness conveyed by a track.
* **Key:** The key of the track. (Consider including mode as well)
* **Time Signature:** The time signature of a track. (Optional)

## Methodology

**Preprocessing Techniques:**

1. **Removal of duplicates:** Duplicate entries were removed using `drop_duplicates()`.
2. **Handling missing values:** Rows with missing values were dropped using `dropna()`. Consider exploring imputation techniques for future improvements.
3. **Conversion of categorical columns:** Categorical columns like 'Artist Names', 'Artist(s) Genres', and potentially 'Genre' (if applicable) were converted to numerical using `astype('category').cat.codes`. One-hot encoding might be more suitable depending on the number of categories.

**Data Analysis:**

* **Correlation analysis:** Explored relationships between features using correlation coefficients. Visualize the correlation matrix for easy interpretation.
* **Mutual information analysis:** Identified features with the strongest mutual information with the target variable (popularity) to select the most informative features. Visualize the top features for understanding their importance.

**Feature Selection:**

Based on the data analysis, the top 10 most informative features were selected using mutual information to create regression models. Consider exploring other feature selection techniques like feature importance from models for future iterations.

**Training and Testing Sets:**

The dataset was split into training and testing sets using a standard 80:20 ratio or as required by your specific models.

**Regression Techniques:**

Two regression techniques were employed to predict song popularity:

1. **Random Forest Regressor:** A tree-based ensemble method.
2. **Gradient Boosting Regressor:** A sequential ensemble method.

**Model Comparison:**

* **Random Forest Regressor:**
    * Mean Squared Error (MSE): [Insert results]
    * Mean Absolute Error (MAE): [Insert results]
    * R-squared Score: [Insert results]
* **Gradient Boosting Regressor:**
    * MSE: [Insert results]
    * MAE: [Insert results]
    * R-squared Score: [Insert results]

**Resultant Regression Line Plots:**

If applicable, include screenshots of the regression line plots generated by the models. This visually depicts the relationship between the predicted popularity and the actual popularity.

## Conclusion

This project investigated the factors influencing song popularity through regression techniques. Preprocessing techniques ensured data quality, feature selection focused on the most informative features, and model training and evaluation compared the effectiveness of Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Regressors.
